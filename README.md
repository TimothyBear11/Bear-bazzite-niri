# bazzite-niri

A custom image based on Bazzite with the intention to keep as close to Bazzite as possible but with [niri](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri) as the window manager and several pre-installed programs for enabling the expected desktop environment experience.

## How I use this

I don't use my laptop often, but when I do, it's running bazzite-niri. I've tried all kinds of tweaks to KDE and Gnome, and nothing feels better than niri. The scrolling WM combined with excellent focus handling and default keybinds makes niri the best-feeling way to use my laptop.
